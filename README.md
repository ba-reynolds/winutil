# winutil

A collection of personal utility scripts for Windows, written in Python.  
These scripts interact directly with the Windows API using only the standard library (no third-party dependencies).  
They are intended for personal use to automate or simplify various Windows tasks.

## Features

- Control Windows watermark visibility
- Reformat clipboard text
- Turn off monitors
- Other small utilities

## Usage

Each script is standalone and can be run directly with Python 3 on Windows.  
See the [src/](winutil/src/) directory for available scripts.
